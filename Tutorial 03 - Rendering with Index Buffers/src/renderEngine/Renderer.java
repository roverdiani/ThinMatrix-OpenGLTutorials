     * by binding it. We also need to enable the relevant attributes of the VAO,
     * which in this case is just attribute 0 where we stored the position data.
     *
     * The VAO can then be rendered to the screen using glDrawElements(). Using
     * this draw method tells OpenGL that we want to use the index buffer to
     * determine how the vertices should be connected instead of just connecting
     * the vertices together in the order that they are stored in the VAO.
     *
     * We tell it what type of shapes to render and the number of vertices that
     * it needs to render. We also tell it was format the index data is in (we
     * used ints) and finally we indicate where in the index buffer it should
     * start rendering. We want it to start right at the beginning and render
     * everything, so we put 0.
     *
     * After rendering we unbind the VAO and disable the attribute.
     *
     * @param model
     *            - The model to be rendered.
